=== `lambda` functions

This is a shorthand notation for _really simple_ functions that can be
encapsulated in a single line. You won't find yourself using them an
awful lot, but it's a good tool to have in your kit.

The basic syntax for lambdas is:

[source,python]
fn = lambda <parameters>:<return calculation>

Unlike standard functions a `lambda` has no return statement, instead simply
returning what was passed. There is no function name, with the `lambda` instead
assigned to a variable. However, parameters follow the same standard function rules.

[source,python,stdout]
----
add1 = lambda x:x+1
add1(1)
----

[source,python,stdout]
----
makedict = lambda **kwargs:kwargs
makedict(hello=1)
----

One common use of lambdas is to extract a key from a tuple for sorting. For
example the following lambda will extract and return element 1 from the supplied
`list` or `tuple`:

[source,pythons]
----
lambda k: k[1]
----

We'll see this in action in a later chapter.


=== Delays

You can wait for a while using the `sleep` function available from the `time` module.
It accepts a duration in seconds (as a `float` for fractional seconds) and waits
the specified time before returned control.

[source,python]
----
from time import sleep
sleep(3)
----

=== Philosophy

If you've had experience with other programming languages, or want
to understand the way Python works in a little more detail, it
may be worth reading this short section. If you think ignorance is
bliss feel free to move on — you don't _need_ to know any of this, though it will
make you a better Python programmer if you do.

==== Pythonic

If you start hanging around Python programmers you'll start hearing the word
‘Pythonic’ a lot. _Pythonic_ isn't a set standard, more an agreed idea of
how Python code _should_ look and be written. It emphasises clarity, simplicity
and the avoidance of tricks. The goal is to write code that _everyone_ can understand.

The principles underlying Python development have
been summarised in the _Zen of Python_:

[quote, Tim Peters]
____
Beautiful is better than ugly. +
Explicit is better than implicit. +
Simple is better than complex. +
Complex is better than complicated. +
Flat is better than nested. +
Sparse is better than dense. +
Readability counts. +
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. +
Although practicality beats purity. +
Errors should never pass silently. +
Unless explicitly silenced. +
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. +
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. +
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. +
Now is better than never. +
Although never is often better than right now. +
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. +
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. +
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! +
____

Which, ironically, is an overly long way of saying "simplicity is best".

=== Comments

_Good_ comments are key to _understandable_ code. If you are
sharing your code with someone else they are _essential_ to
ensure your aims are clear. By making the purpose of a block of
code obvious others can check your logic for mistakes.

[source,python]
-----
def my_magic_function(x):
    """

    """
-----

“But, I'm not going to share my code” you say?

What if you come back to this block of code next week, next month, next year?
If you're over 30 you probably have trouble remembering what
you did yesterday. Save yourself from future headaches, comment as you go.

TIP: Comment your code clearly enough that its meaning will be clear to you 3 months later, on
a bad day, with no coffee.


==== Dynamic typing

Python is a _dynamically typed_ language which in English means that
you can assign any type of value to any variable at any time. This
means that you can do things like this:

[source,python,stdout]
----
a = 5
----
....
....

[source,python,stdout]
----
a = 'hello'
a
----
....
....

[source,python,stdout]
----
a = 1.2
a
----
....
....

If you're looking at that and thinking “Well, that makes sense.” welcome
to the club. In many languages you would need to define the `type` of `a`
when creating it. If we defined it as `int` and then tried to assign a `str` to
we would get an error.

This _dynamic typing_ gives you a lot of freedom in your code: you
don't need to think about how you are going to use a variable before you
create it, you can store special values such as `None` in any variable and
you can re-use temporary variables without making sure they are of the correct type.

But, just because you _can_ do something doesn't mean you _should_. So think
carefully about how you re-use variables and keep them descriptive. It also
leaves you open to _type errors_ where you try to do something with
a variable thinking it's one type and it's another. Thankfully there are
ways to deal with this.

==== Duck typing

Another core Python concept that it's worth getting your head around
is that of _duck typing_.

[quote, James Whitcomb Riley]
When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.

What this means in practise is that rather than worrying about what
_type_ a variable is, instead consider what _properties_ a variable has. This is
particularly relevant when we start using custom classes. Say we create a custom
class that has the functionality of a standard Python dictionary.
We _should_ be able to substitute our new class in for a dictionary and pass this
to any function we like.

But imagine whoever wrote that function didn't know anything about ducks.
They start out defining the function like this:

[source,python]
----
def my_awesome_function(dict_in):
    """
    Accepts a variable dict_in of type `dict` and returns it
    with keys and values swapped (destructive if duplicate values exist!)
    """
    dict_out = dict()
    for key, value in dict_in.items():
        dict_out[value] = key
    return dict_out
----

Lets try executing this:

[source,python,stdout]
----
data = { 'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3 }
data = my_awesome_function(data):
data
----
....
....

But then someone who hasn't read the documentation comes along and tries to
call the function with a `list`:

[source,python,stdout]
----
data = [1,2,3,4]
data = my_awesome_function(data):
data
----
....
....

Well, that doesn't work. But the author of the function wants to catch
this error more elegantly — perhaps raising a helpful exception to
describe the problem. Lets update the function:

[source,python]
----
def my_awesome_function(dict_in):
    """
    Accepts a variable dict_in of type `dict` and returns it
    with keys and values swapped (destructive if duplicate values exist!)
    """

    if type(dict_in) != dict:
        raise Exception("Please supply a dictionary.")

    dict_out = dict()
    for key, value in dict_in.items():
        dict_out[value] = key
    return dict_out
----

Great! Right? Not really. While this will certainly solve our `list` failure, it
only works if `dict_in` is _exactly_ of the type `dict`. If we're using a
subclassed type such as `defaultdict` this will now fail.

[source,python,stdout]
----
from collections import defaultdict
my_dict = defaultdict(int)
type(my_dict) == defaultdict
----
....
....

[source,python,stdout]
----
type(my_dict) == dict
----
....
....

We _could_ work around this
by using `isinstance()`. This returns true if the `dict_in` object is of the
class `dict` or of _any subclass_ of `dict`:

[source,python,stdout]
----
isinstance(my_dict, dict)
----
....
....

We could implement this in the function as follows:

[source,python]
----
def my_awesome_function(dict_in):
    """
    Accepts a variable dict_in of type `dict` and returns it
    with keys and values swapped (destructive if duplicate values exist!)
    """

    if isinstance(dict_in, dict):
        raise Exception("Please supply a dictionary.")

    dict_out = dict()
    for key, value in dict_in.items():
        dict_out[value] = key
    return dict_out
----

Sorted? Still no. This code will still fail for any `dict`-like object
that isn't a subclass of `dict`.

So how can we work around this? This brings
us back to ducks. In the function we use a single feature of the `dict` type:
the `.items()` property. If that is the feature we want, that is the feature we should test.

The simplest way to do this is simply call the attribute and catch the `Exception`:

[source,python]
----
def my_awesome_function(dict_in):
    """
    Accepts a variable dict_in of type `dict` and returns it
    with keys and values swapped (destructive if duplicate values exist!)
    """

    try:
        dict_in.items()
    except AttributeError:
        raise Exception("Please supply a dictionary-like type.")

    dict_out = dict()
    for key, value in dict_in.items():
        dict_out[value] = key
    return dict_out
----

We could even re-structure this to avoid the double-call to the `.items()` property,
as follows:

[source,python]
----
def my_awesome_function(dict_in):
    """
    Accepts a variable dict_in of type `dict` and returns it
    with keys and values swapped (destructive if duplicate values exist!)
    """
    dict_out = dict()

    try:
        for key, value in dict_in.items():
            dict_out[value] = key

    except AttributeError:
        raise Exception("Please supply a dictionary-like type.")

    return dict_out
----

Now we take the dictionary `dict_in` and attempt to _use_ it like a dictionary.
If we catch an `AttributeError` exception (which here can _only_ come from the `dict_in.items()` )
we raise a more descriptive exception for the user.

[source,python,stdout]
----
data = [1,2,3,4]
data = my_awesome_function(data):
----
....
....

The _duck typing_ principle is a key part of writing _Pythonic_ code. This example
also leads us nicely into the next section.

=== Key Packages

==== Quick Start

If you don't want to read the descriptions of the packages to install
you can skip this section. Just run the following commands to install
the neccessary packages on your system:

[.terminal]
----
pip install matplotlib seaborn ggplot2 pandas
----

==== The numpy-scipy Stack `numpy scipy`


==== Plotting `matplotlib seaborn ggplot2`

If you want to plot something with Python, you're going to use _matplotlib_.
Started in [] it has established itself as the _de facto_ core plotting
library for all things Python. Even where alternative plotting libraries exist
(_seaborn_, _ggplot2_) they all use _matplotlib_ as a backend.

The good news is that it's an incredibly powerful library, the bad news is
that it has a dated and quirky interface (hence why the other interfaces
exist). But no fear! With a bit of practise you'll be tweaking out pretty
publication plots in no time.

To get the best of both worlds we're going to install both matplotlib
and a couple of alternative interfaces.

[.terminal]
----
pip3 install matplotlib seaborn ggplot2
----

TIP: _ggplot2_ is a Python implementation of the "Grammar of Graphics"
seen in the R package of the same name. If you have experience with _ggplot_ or
_ggplot2_ in R you'll feel right at home.

==== Data tables `pandas`

There is a lot of research time spent shuffling around tables of data: usually
in the format of Excel spreadsheets or CSV (Comma Separated Values) format files.
If we want to use Python as part of our data shuffling workflow, it needs to be
able to read and write these files itself. Helpfully there is an library
for doing just that called _Pandas_.

_Pandas_ neatly integrates with the _numpy_ and _scipy_ packages allowing
for some really powerful data analysis. It even comes with it's own
simple plotting functions (built on, you guessed it, _matplotlib_). We
can install it just like any other Python package:

[.terminal]
----
pip3 install pandas
----

== Introduction

Lab books are an essential way to keep track of methods used to
generate results. In the same way
this book is built around a series of reusable examples to produce
scientific results. By reading, reproducing and exploring these
examples you will learn to use the Python programming language
and associated tools to speed up and improve the reproducibility
of your science.

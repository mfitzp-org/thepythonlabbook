== Python Basics

Before you can use Python for your science, you're going to need to learn
Python, right? No, not exactly. The goal here is to teach you how to use
Python for your science, and no more. However, there are still some common
concepts that it is useful to understand.

This chapter assumes some passing familiarity with Python or programming and should
serve as a reminder or refresher. It will  introduce common concepts including variables, functions, iteration, comprehension
and classes. If that sounds deathly boring, it is because it is. But it will
be over quickly, and then you can get on to making awesome science.

TIP: If you don't have previous experience with Python, or you want to
learn more about the things covered in this chapter you can take a look
at our [recommended resources].

This entire book is based on (and frequently updated to) the current latest
version of Python which as of writing is Python 3.4.

=== Mathematical operators

Let's ease into things with some simple sums. Python provides a set of basic
operators for performing calculations and helpfully, you can enter these
calculations literally into the Python interpreter.

==== Basic operators

The operators available are: addition `a+b`, subtraction `a-b`, division `a/b`,
power x^n `x**n`. There should be no surprises here:

[source,python]
----
>>> 1 + 5
6

>>> 5 - 7
-2

>>> 8 / 2
4.0

>>> 8 / 3
2.6666666666666665

>>> 2 ** 8
256
----

WARNING: If you're using Python2.7 you'll notice that `/` will give you a different
results: +
`8 / 2 = 4` +
`8 / 3 = 2` +
This is because before Python3 `/` performed _integer division_ on whole numbers.
If you place a `.0` at the end of the numbers this changes their _type_ and performs
the calculation using _float division_: +
`8.0 / 2 = 4.0` +
`8.0 / 3 = 2.6666666666666665` +
Much better! We will discuss _integers_ and _floats_ in more detail later in this chapter.


==== Strange ones

There are a few additional operators which you may not be familiar with but will
find useful. These
are modulus `a%b` and integer division `a//b`. These operators are related in
a useful way. _Integer division_ performs division but _always_ returns a whole
number, throwing away the remainder. _Modulus_ gives you that remainder.

[source,python]
----
>>> 6 // 3
2

>>> 6 % 3
0

>>> 7 // 3
2

>>> 7 % 3
1
----

These operators become particularly useful when you're trying to do something to every
__n__th value or you want to split large numbers into upper and lower parts.

[source,python]
----
>>> 123456 // 1000
123

>>> 123456 % 1000
456
----


=== Comparisons

Is 2 bigger than 1? Yes. But how do you ask the same question in Python?
Python provides a number of _comparison operators_ that allow you
to describe these sorts of comparisons in your code. If you have any
experience with mathematics some of these will be quite familiar.


==== `is` Weirdness

It is important to remember that `is` tests of object sameness, not equivalance.
Imagine you have two piles of 10 apples. While these two piles are _equal_ you
would not argue they are _the same_ pile.

There are few hidden quirks of how Python work that can be exposed — intentionally,
or accidentally — by incorrect use of `is`. For example, Python stores `str` of
20 or less characters only once - re-using the strings just re-references this store.
This means that two identical `str` of 20 chacters or less are both _equal_ and
_the same_, while identical longer strings are only _equal_.

    x = 'a' * 20
    y = 'a' * 20
    x is y
    True

    x = 'a' * 21
    y = 'a' * 21
    x is y
    False

The same principal applies to numbers less than or equal to 256 (not coincidentally
the size of one `byte`):

    a = 256
    b = 256
    a is b
    True

    a = 257
    b = 257
    a is b
    False

But, if you assign the two values at the same time they become _the same_ again.

    a = 257; b = 257
    a is b
    True

If this seems like weird voodoo magic don't worry. This who issue is neatly
sidestepped by using `is` correctly. Only use `is` when you want to test that
two _objects_ are the same. You almost never want to do this — with testing against
None being the obvious exception. If in doubt use `==`.


=== Variables


In computer programming, a variable or scalar is a storage location paired with
an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown
quantity or information referred to as a value. The variable name is the usual
way to reference the stored value; this separation of name and content allows
the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents.
The identifier in computer source code can be bound to a value during run
time, and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of
program execution.


==== integers `int`

An _integer_ is a whole number with no fractional parts. For example `4` is an integer
while `4.5` is not. In programming the concept of integer is slightly stricter
than you might think. Is `4.0` an integer? Mathematically yes, computationally no.

You can use the `int` type to cast `float` values to an `int`. This will throw
away any fractional part of the number.

[source,python]
----
>>> int(4.3)
4

----

==== floats `float`

A _float_ is a floating-point representation of a number. The name _floating
point_ refers to the fact that the decimal point position is not fixed, but
'floats'. The position of the decimal point gives a trade-off between the
range of supported values and the precision of those values.
This can be compared to _decimal_ types, where the position of the decimal
point is fixed, and therefore precision is exactly known.

TIP: `float` is not used with financial data for this reason. Over time this small
error will accumulate into missing fractions of money — and _nobody_ likes losing money.

In Python floats are sufficiently large that the effects of these tradeoffs are
not likely to affect your results. But there are gotchas to watch out for,
particularly when trying to compare floating point values:

[source,python]
----
>>> 0.1 + 0.2
0.3000000004

>>> 0.1+0.2 == 0.3
False
----

Here the inaccuracy of the representation results in a counterintuitive result
for the comparison. The simple solution to this is: _don't test floats for equality!_

==== character strings `str`

Strings in Python (3+) are represented using _unicode_.
If you don't know what that is don't worry, you probably won't need to know
anything much about it. In simple terms _unicode_ is a way of _encoding_ characters in a portable way.
It provides support for complex characters (think of all the non-English alphabets)
right-to-left text and even emoji (👍).

In practise you can just think `str` is ‘text’ and leave it at that.

TIP: In earlier versions of Python `str` was _not_ unicode. However you could
define unicode string literals using the `u` prefix: `u'my unicode string'`.

==== byte strings `byte`

Byte strings are _simple strings_ that do not support unicode. Instead they are
based on the ASCII standard allowing for 256 (or one _byte_ worth of) characters.
These are now most commonly used for network protocols where unicode
is not supported. You probably won't make much use of these, but they are
worth knowing about. You can define byte strings using a `b` prefix, e.g.

[source,python]
----
b'my byte string'
----

==== tuples `tuple`
==== lists `list`
==== sets `set`
==== dictionaries `dict`

Dictionaries are simple data stores where _values_ are stored attached to a
given _key_. Stored values can be retried by reference to the same key in
future. Keys must be unique, but values may be the same.

You can define a dictionary using the `dict` type as follows:

[source,python]
----
>>> my_dict = dict()
>>> my_dict['a'] = 'hello'
----

You can read the values out by key as follows:

[source,python]
----
>>> my_dict['a']
'hello'
----

You can also define dictionaries using the `{'key':value}` literal syntax:

[source,python]
----
>>> my_dict = {'a':'hello', 'b':'goodbye'}
>>> my_dict['b']
'goodbye'
----

===== Storing multiple values under a single key

It is possible to store multiple values by using other Python types as values. For
example you could store a list of values under a single key.

[source,python]
----
>>> my_dict = dict()
>>> my_dict['a'] = [1,2,3,4]
>>> my_dict
{'a': [1, 2, 3, 4]}

>>> my_dict['a']
[1, 2, 3, 4]
----

You can even store dictionaries as values in dictionaries.

[source,python]
----
>>> my_dict = dict()
>>> my_dict['c'] = {'d': 'whatever', 'e': 'you', 'f': 'like'}
>>> my_dict
{'c': {'e': 'you', 'd': 'whatever', 'f': 'like'}}
----

TIP: As a general rule you don't want to mix simple and complex types in
your dictionary values. In fact, you usually want to keep all values
of the same type.

===== Default values with `defaultdict`


===== Counting occurrences `Counter`


==== arrays `ndarray`

There is a native `array` type in Python which behaves like a type-constrained list.
However, we won't be using it — instead we'll be focusing on the much more flexible _NumPy_ array type
`ndarray`. This supports multi-dimensional arrays (2D, 3D, and more) of mixed and complex
types and gives us access to powerful _NumPy_ and _SciPy_ data analysis functions.

_NumPy_ arrays are defined as...

==== booleans `True` and `False`

_Boolean_ values are those with two possible states for example
_true and false_ or _1 and 0_. Python defines two types to
represent `True` and `False` and these can be used to test
equality.

The examples below give a quick overview of how `True` and `False`
values can be used:

[source,python]
----
>>> 1 is 1
True

>>> True == True
True

>>> True == False
False

>>> (1 == 1) == True
True

>>> (1 == 2) == True
False

>>> (1 == 2) == False
True
----

In _NumPy_ `True` and `False` values are also commonly used
for _masking_ — or _selecting_ — values from arrays. This will
be covered in more detail in the next chapter.



==== `None` of the above

So far you've been introduced to variable types for representing
numbers, strings of characters, lists, groups and dictionaries
of objects, arrays and true and false values. But sometimes you'll
want a value that is decicdely d) none of the above.

.This is a picture of nothing.
image::./img/030-python-none.jpg[]

Python provides for this in the `None` type.
Here are some things about `None`:

- `None` is equal to `None`
- `None` is not equal to _anything_ else
- all things that are `None` are equal
- all things that are `None` are the same

If the last two seem a little esoteric don't worry. Look at the examples below
to understand what is going on:

.`None` is equal to itself
[source, python]
----
>>> None == None
True

>>> None > None
False
----

.`None` is not equal to _anything_ else
[source, python]
----
>>> 1 == None
False

>>> 'hello' == None
False
----

.All things that are `None` are equal
[source, python]
----
>>> a = None
>>> b = None

>>> a == None
True

>>> a == b
True
----

.All things that are `None` are the same
[source, python]
----
>>> a = None
>>> b = None

>>> a is None
True

>>> a is b
True
----

The common use for `None` is as a representation of a non-existent value. For the
sake of your sanity it's best to stick with this approach.

TIP: Don't use `None` to mean _something_.

==== `inf` and beyond

There are two other not-really-a-number numbers
provided by _numpy_ that you may encounter. These are
`nan` and `inf`.

"Not a number" or `nan` is used whenever a number
was expected but was not found — if you read a
`str` value into a numeric array, for example. Since it is not possible to represent
the string "Slartibartfast" as a number a `nan` will be used
in its place. Later we'll see how `nan` value can also be used as
_filler_ in arrays for values that you want to ignore.

When numeric calculations
go out of bounds or produce an unrepresentable number you'll instead
see infinity: `inf` or
its negative partner `-inf`. This indicates that what is there
_is a number_ but not one you can do anything with.

There is not much more to say about that.

==== Equality

To test for equality use the double-equals `==` sign.

[source,python]
----
>>> 1 == 2
False

>>> 1 == 1
True
----

WARNING: A single `=` is
used to assign a value to a variable. Mixing these up is a common source of
bugs, but Python will usually tell you when you do it.

[source,python]
----
>>> 1 = 1
----
----
SyntaxError: can't assign to literal
----

[source,python]
----
if a = 1:
   print("OK")
----
----
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
----

You can also test if something is greater `>`, less than `<`,
greater or equal `>=` and less than or equal `<=` to something else.


[source,python]
----
>>> 5 > 2
True

>>> 2 > 2
False

>>> 2 >= 2
True

>>> 5 >= 6
False

>>> 6 <= 6
True

>>> 5 <= 6
True

>>> 2 < 6
True

>>> 2 < 2
False
----

TIP: The order of the `>` or `<` and the `=` is important. If you write `=>` you will
get an error. Remember it as ``greater or equal'' and ``less than, equal'' you'll
get it in the right order.


==== Sameness

`is`

==== Negation


==== Combining operators


=== Control structures `if...elif...else`



=== Iteration

You will often find yourself wanting to do things _more than once_. The naïve way
to do this is to copy and paste your code multiple times. But this is a _bad idea_.
If you find a bug in your code, you now have to fix it in multiple places. What happens if you miss one?
Bad things, that's what.

Thankfully Python provides a nice simple way to get things done _over and over again_. In
programming parlance this is called _iteration_. You will also hear the phrase
_iterate over_ which means working — one item at a time — through a sequence.
We'll take a close look at those now.

==== The `for...in` loop



==== For a `while`

Sometimes you don't know how long your loop needs to go on. In that case you
can't provide a range to the `for` loop as you don't know how big it needs to be.
Instead you can use the `while` construct which continues to loop
_while_ something is `True`.

[source,python]
----

----

A special case of this that you might find yourself using is the _infinite loop with break_.
Here we set `True` as the loop conditional which as we already know _always equals_ `True`.
The loop will continue until `break` is reached and the loop exits.

[source,python]
----
n = 0

while True:
    n += 1
    if n > 100:
        break
----

This construct can be useful when waiting for another task (or a remote API) to
complete. But in that case you will want to add a wait into the loop to avoid
being antisocial.


=== Functions

As your scripts grow in size you'll start to notice that you re-use common pieces
of code in different places. This can become messy and cause problems for
maintenance —

The solution to this is to use _functions_ to




=== List, Dict Comprehensions

=== Imports and Modules


=== Classes


=== Exceptions

=== Regular Expressions

=== `lambda` functions

This is a shorthand notation for _really simple_ functions that can be
encapsulated in a single line. You won't find yourself using them an
awful lot, but it's a good tool to have in your kit.

The basic syntax for lambdas is:

[source,python]
fn = lambda <parameters>:<return calculation>

Unlike standard functions a `lambda` has no return statement, instead simply
returning what was passed. There is no function name, with the `lambda` instead
assigned to a variable. However, parameters follow the same standard function rules.

[source,python]
----
>>> add1 = lambda x:x+1

>>> add1(1)
2
----

[source,python]
----
>>> makedict = lambda **kwargs:kwargs

>>> makedict(hello=1)
{'hello': 1}
----

One common use of lambdas is to extract a key from a tuple for sorting. For
example the following lambda will extract and return element 1 from the supplied
`list` or `tuple`:

[source,python]
lambda k: k[1]

We'll see this in action in a later chapter.


=== Delays

You can wait for a while using the `sleep` function available from the `time` module.
It accepts a duration in seconds (as a `float` for fractional seconds) and waits
the specified time before returned control.

[source,python]
----
>>> from time import sleep
>>> sleep(3)
----

=== Input




=== Comments

It is often useful to explain _in plain language_ what a piece of
code you have written is doing. In programming these bits of description
are called `comments'. They are completely ignored by Python while it runs
your code. It's a good habit to get used to commenting your code
thoroughly to keep it maintainable and clear.

TIP: If you format comments properly
they can even be used to automatically generate documentation for your software.

Python supports two types of comment: _inline_ and _block_.

==== Inline comments

Inline comments are single-line additions, usually after the line of source
code that they are commenting. For example:

[source,python]
----
cat = "Otgon"  # A good name for a cat
----

==== Block comments

Block comments are multi-line and are used for larger chunks of
documentation. They can be defined  using three single or double
quotation marks in a row, but double quotes are preferred:

[source,python]
----
"""
This is a multi-line block comment
that tells you something very interesting.
"""
----

TIP: Multi-line comments are actually string literals. You can
use the same syntax to assign multi-line strings to a variable.




=== Philosophy

If you've had experience with other programming languages, or want
to understand the way Python works in a little more detail, it
may be worth reading this short section. If you think ignorance is
bliss feel free to move on — you don't _need_ to know any of this, though it will
make you a better Python programmer if you do.

==== Pythonic

If you start hanging around Python programmers you'll start hearing the word
‘Pythonic’ a lot. _Pythonic_ isn't a set standard, more an agreed idea of
how Python code _should_ look and be written. It emphasises clarity, simplicity
and the avoidance of tricks. The goal is to write code that _everyone_ can understand.

The principles underlying Python development have
been summarised in the _Zen of Python_:

[quote, Tim Peters]
____
Beautiful is better than ugly. +
Explicit is better than implicit. +
Simple is better than complex. +
Complex is better than complicated. +
Flat is better than nested. +
Sparse is better than dense. +
Readability counts. +
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. +
Although practicality beats purity. +
Errors should never pass silently. +
Unless explicitly silenced. +
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. +
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. +
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. +
Now is better than never. +
Although never is often better than right now. +
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. +
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. +
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! +
____

Which, ironically, is an overly long way of saying "simplicity is best".


==== Needs more PEP (specifically 8)




=== Comments

_Good_ comments are key to _understandable_ code. If you are
sharing your code with someone else they are _essential_ to
ensure your aims are clear. By making the purpose of a block of
code obvious others can check your logic for mistakes.

[source,python]
-----
def my_magic_function(x):
    """

    """
-----

“But, I'm not going to share my code” you say?

What if you come back to this block of code next week, next month, next year?
If you're over 30 you probably have trouble remembering what
you did yesterday. Save yourself from future headaches, comment as you go.

TIP: Comment your code clearly enough that its meaning will be clear to you 3 months later, on
a bad day, with no coffee.


==== Dynamic typing

Python is a _dynamically typed_ language which in English means that
you can assign any type of value to any variable at any time. This
means that you can do things like this:

[source,python]
----
>>> a = 5
>>> a
5
>>> a = 'hello'
>>> a
'hello'
>>> a = 1.2
>>> a
1.2
----

If you're looking at that and thinking “Well, that makes sense.” welcome
to the club. In many languages you would need to define the `type` of `a`
when creating it. If we defined it as `int` and then tried to assign a `str` to
we would get an error.

This _dynamic typing_ gives you a lot of freedom in your code: you
don't need to think about how you are going to use a variable before you
create it, you can store special values such as `None` in any variable and
you can re-use temporary variables without making sure they are of the correct type.

But, just because you _can_ do something doesn't mean you _should_. So think
carefully about how you re-use variables and keep them descriptive. It also
leaves you open to _type errors_ where you try to do something with
a variable thinking it's one type and it's another. Thankfully there are
ways to deal with this.

==== Duck typing

Another core Python concept that it's worth getting your head around
is that of _duck typing_.

[quote, James Whitcomb Riley]
When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.

What this means in practise is that rather than worrying about what
_type_ a variable is, instead consider what _properties_ a variable has. This is
particularly relevant when we start using custom classes. Say we create a custom
class that has the functionality of a standard Python dictionary.
We _should_ be able to substitute our new class in for a dictionary and pass this
to any function we like.

.This passes the duck test (Photo: Alain Carpenter)
image::./img/030-python-duck.jpg[]


But imagine whoever wrote that function didn't know anything about ducks.
They start out defining the function like this:

[source,python]
----
def my_awesome_function(dict_in):
    """
    Accepts a variable dict_in of type `dict` and returns it
    with keys and values swapped (destructive if duplicate values exist!)
    """
    dict_out = dict()
    for key, value in dict_in.items():
        dict_out[value] = key
    return dict_out
----

Lets try executing this:

[source,python]
----
>>> data = { 'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3 }
>>> data = my_awesome_function(data):
>>> data
{ 1:'a', 2:'b', 3:'c' }
----

But then someone who hasn't read the documentation comes along and tries to
call the function with a `list`:

[source,python]
----
>>> data = [1,2,3,4]
>>> data = my_awesome_function(data):
>>> data
[ERROR]
----

Well, that doesn't work. But the author of the function wants to catch
this error more elegantly — perhaps raising a helpful exception to
describe the problem. Lets update the function:

[source,python]
----
def my_awesome_function(dict_in):
    """
    Accepts a variable dict_in of type `dict` and returns it
    with keys and values swapped (destructive if duplicate values exist!)
    """

    if type(dict_in) != dict:
        raise Exception("Please supply a dictionary.")

    dict_out = dict()
    for key, value in dict_in.items():
        dict_out[value] = key
    return dict_out
----

Great! Right? Not really. While this will certainly solve our `list` failure, it
only works if `dict_in` is _exactly_ of the type `dict`. If we're using a
subclassed type such as `defaultdict` this will now fail.

[source,python]
----
from collections import defaultdict
my_dict = defaultdict(int)

>>> type(my_dict) == defaultdict
True

>>> type(my_dict) == dict
False
----

We _could_ work around this
by using `isinstance()`. This returns true if the `dict_in` object is of the
class `dict` or of _any subclass_ of `dict`:

[source,python]
----
>>> isinstance(my_dict, dict)
True
----

We could implement this in the function as follows:

[source,python]
----
def my_awesome_function(dict_in):
    """
    Accepts a variable dict_in of type `dict` and returns it
    with keys and values swapped (destructive if duplicate values exist!)
    """

    if isinstance(dict_in, dict):
        raise Exception("Please supply a dictionary.")

    dict_out = dict()
    for key, value in dict_in.items():
        dict_out[value] = key
    return dict_out
----

Sorted? Still no. This code will still fail for any `dict`-like object
that isn't a subclass of `dict`.

So how can we work around this? This brings
us back to ducks. In the function we use a single feature of the `dict` type:
the `.items()` property. If that is the feature we want, that is the feature we should test.

The simplest way to do this is simply call the attribute and catch the `Exception`:

[source,python]
----
def my_awesome_function(dict_in):
    """
    Accepts a variable dict_in of type `dict` and returns it
    with keys and values swapped (destructive if duplicate values exist!)
    """

    try:
        dict_in.items()
    except AttributeError:
        raise Exception("Please supply a dictionary-like type.")

    dict_out = dict()
    for key, value in dict_in.items():
        dict_out[value] = key
    return dict_out
----

We could even re-structure this to avoid the double-call to the `.items()` property,
as follows:

[source,python]
----
def my_awesome_function(dict_in):
    """
    Accepts a variable dict_in of type `dict` and returns it
    with keys and values swapped (destructive if duplicate values exist!)
    """
    dict_out = dict()

    try:
        for key, value in dict_in.items():
            dict_out[value] = key

    except AttributeError:
        raise Exception("Please supply a dictionary-like type.")

    return dict_out
----

Now we take the dictionary `dict_in` and attempt to _use_ it like a dictionary.
If we catch an `AttributeError` exception (which here can _only_ come from the `dict_in.items()` )
we raise a more descriptive exception for the user.

[source,python]
----
>>> data = [1,2,3,4]
>>> data = my_awesome_function(data):
>>> data
[NICE ERROR]
----

The _duck typing_ principle is a key part of writing _Pythonic_ code. This example
also leads us nicely into the next section.

==== Ask for forgiveness, not permission

WARNING: This is a programming principle, not life advice.



==== Monty Python

Despite what the logo may suggest the Python programming language has nothing
whatsoever to do with snakes. It is named after the British comedy series
“Monty Python and the Flying Circus” by the group of the same name. Which
incidentally also has nothing to do with snakes.

This links shows up various places in the _Python_ world. For example, the

== Python Basics

Before you can use Python for your science, you're going to need to learn
Python, right? No, not exactly. The goal here is to teach you how to use
Python for your science, and no more. However, there are still some common
concepts that it is useful to understand.

This chapter assumes some passing familiarity with Python or programming and should
serve as a reminder or refresher. It will  introduce common concepts including variables, functions, iteration, comprehension
and classes. If that sounds deathly boring, it is because it is. But it will
be over quickly, and then you can get on to making awesome science.

TIP: If you don't have previous experience with Python, or you want to
learn more about the things covered in this chapter you can take a look
at our [recommended resources].

This entire book is based on (and frequently updated to) the current latest
version of Python which as of writing is Python 3.4.

=== Mathematical operators

Let's ease into things with some simple sums. Python provides a set of basic
operators for performing calculations and helpfully, you can enter these
calculations literally into the Python interpreter.

==== Basic operators

The operators available are: addition `a+b`, subtraction `a-b`, division `a/b`,
power x^n `x**n`. There should be no surprises here:

[source,python]
----
1 + 5
----
....
6
....

[source,python]
----
5 - 7
----
....
-2
....

[source,python]
----
8 / 2
----
....
4
....

[source,python]
----
8 / 3
----
....
2
....

[source,python]
----
2 ** 8
----
....
256
....

WARNING: If you're using Python2.7 you'll notice that `/` will give you a different
results: +
`8 / 2 = 4` +
`8 / 3 = 2` +
This is because before Python3 `/` performed _integer division_ on whole numbers.
If you place a `.0` at the end of the numbers this changes their _type_ and performs
the calculation using _float division_: +
`8.0 / 2 = 4.0` +
`8.0 / 3 = 2.6666666666666665` +
Much better! We will discuss _integers_ and _floats_ in more detail later in this chapter.


==== Strange ones

There are a few additional operators which you may not be familiar with but will
find useful. These
are modulus `a%b` and integer division `a//b`. These operators are related in
a useful way. _Integer division_ performs division but _always_ returns a whole
number, throwing away the remainder. _Modulus_ gives you that remainder.

[source,python]
----
6 // 3
----
....
2
....

[source,python]
----
6 % 3
----
....
0
....

[source,python]
----
7 // 3
----
....
2
....

[source,python]
----
7 % 3
----
....
1
....

These operators become particularly useful when you're trying to do something to every
__n__th value or you want to split large numbers into upper and lower parts.


[source,python]
----
123456 // 1000
----
....
123
....

[source,python]
----
123456 % 1000
----
....
456
....


=== Comparisons

Is 2 bigger than 1? Yes. But how do you ask the same question in Python?
Python provides a number of _comparison operators_ that allow you
to describe these sorts of comparisons in your code. If you have any
experience with mathematics some of these will be quite familiar.


==== `is` Weirdness

It is important to remember that `is` tests of object sameness, not equivalance.
Imagine you have two piles of 10 apples. While these two piles are _equal_ you
would not argue they are _the same_ pile.

There are few hidden quirks of how Python work that can be exposed ‚Äî intentionally,
or accidentally ‚Äî by incorrect use of `is`. For example, Python stores `str` of
20 or less characters only once - re-using the strings just re-references this store.
This means that two identical `str` of 20 chacters or less are both _equal_ and
_the same_, while identical longer strings are only _equal_.


[source,python]
----
x = 'a' * 20
y = 'a' * 20
x is y
----
....
True
....

[source,python]
----
x = 'a' * 21
y = 'a' * 21
x is y
----
....
False
....

The same principal applies to numbers less than or equal to 256 (not coincidentally
the size of one `byte`):

[source,python]
----
a = 256
b = 256
a is b
----
....
True
....

[source,python]
----
a = 257
b = 257
a is b
----
....
False
....

But, if you assign the two values at the same time they become _the same_ again.

[source,python]
----
a = 257; b = 257
a is b
----
....
False
....

If this seems like weird voodoo magic don't worry. This who issue is neatly
sidestepped by using `is` correctly. Only use `is` when you want to test that
two _objects_ are the same. You almost never want to do this ‚Äî with testing against
None being the obvious exception. If in doubt use `==`.


=== Variables


In computer programming, a variable or scalar is a storage location paired with
an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown
quantity or information referred to as a value. The variable name is the usual
way to reference the stored value; this separation of name and content allows
the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents.
The identifier in computer source code can be bound to a value during run
time, and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of
program execution.


==== integers `int`

An _integer_ is a whole number with no fractional parts. For example `4` is an integer
while `4.5` is not. In programming the concept of integer is slightly stricter
than you might think. Is `4.0` an integer? Mathematically yes, computationally no.

You can use the `int` type to cast `float` values to an `int`. This will throw
away any fractional part of the number.

[source,python]
----
int(4.3)
----
....
4
....

==== floats `float`

A _float_ is a floating-point representation of a number. The name _floating
point_ refers to the fact that the decimal point position is not fixed, but
'floats'. The position of the decimal point gives a trade-off between the
range of supported values and the precision of those values.
This can be compared to _decimal_ types, where the position of the decimal
point is fixed, and therefore precision is exactly known.

TIP: `float` is not used with financial data for this reason. Over time this small
error will accumulate into missing fractions of money ‚Äî and _nobody_ likes losing money.

In Python floats are sufficiently large that the effects of these tradeoffs are
not likely to affect your results. But there are gotchas to watch out for,
particularly when trying to compare floating point values:

[source,python]
----
0.1 + 0.2
----
....
0.30000000000000004
....

[source,python]
----
0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
----
....
False
....

Here the inaccuracy of the representation results in a counterintuitive result
for the comparison. The simple solution to this is: _don't test floats for equality!_

==== character strings `str`

Strings in Python (3+) are represented using _unicode_.
If you don't know what that is don't worry, you probably won't need to know
anything much about it. In simple terms _unicode_ is a way of _encoding_ characters in a portable way.
It provides support for complex characters (think of all the non-English alphabets)
right-to-left text and even emoji (üëç).

In practise you can just think `str` is ‚Äòtext‚Äô and leave it at that.

TIP: In earlier versions of Python `str` was _not_ unicode. However you could
define unicode string literals using the `u` prefix: `u'my unicode string'`.

==== byte strings `byte`

Byte strings are _simple strings_ that do not support unicode. Instead they are
based on the ASCII standard allowing for 256 (or one _byte_ worth of) characters.
These are now most commonly used for network protocols where unicode
is not supported. You probably won't make much use of these, but they are
worth knowing about. You can define byte strings using a `b` prefix, e.g.

[source,python]
----
b'my byte string'
----

==== tuples `tuple`

Tuples are _immutable_, that is they cannot be


==== lists `list`
==== sets `set`
==== dictionaries `dict`

Dictionaries are simple data stores where _values_ are stored attached to a
given _key_. Stored values can be retried by reference to the same key in
future. Keys must be unique, but values may be the same.

You can define a dictionary using the `dict` type as follows:

[source,python]
----
my_dict = dict()
my_dict['a'] = 'hello'
----

You can read the values out by key as follows:

[source,python]
----
my_dict['a']
----
....
'hello'
....

You can also define dictionaries using the `{'key':value}` literal syntax:

[source,python]
----
my_dict = {'a':'hello', 'b':'goodbye'}
my_dict['b']
----
....
'goodbye'
....

===== Storing multiple values under a single key

It is possible to store multiple values by using other Python types as values. For
example you could store a list of values under a single key.

[source,python]
----
my_dict = dict()
my_dict['a'] = [1,2,3,4]
my_dict
----
....
{'a': [1, 2, 3, 4]}
....

[source,python]
----
my_dict['a']
----
....
[1, 2, 3, 4]
....

You can even store dictionaries as values in dictionaries.

[source,python]
----
my_dict = dict()
my_dict['c'] = {'d': 'whatever', 'e': 'you', 'f': 'like'}
my_dict
----
....
{'c': {'d': 'whatever', 'e': 'you', 'f': 'like'}}
....

TIP: As a general rule you don't want to mix simple and complex types in
your dictionary values. In fact, you usually want to keep all values
of the same type.

===== Default values with `defaultdict`


===== Counting occurrences `Counter`


==== arrays `ndarray`

There is a native `array` type in Python which behaves like a type-constrained list.
However, we won't be using it ‚Äî instead we'll be focusing on the much more flexible _NumPy_ array type
`ndarray`. This supports multi-dimensional arrays (2D, 3D, and more) of mixed and complex
types and gives us access to powerful _NumPy_ and _SciPy_ data analysis functions.

_NumPy_ arrays are defined as...

==== booleans `True` and `False`

_Boolean_ values are those with two possible states for example
_true and false_ or _1 and 0_. Python defines two types to
represent `True` and `False` and these can be used to test
equality.

The examples below give a quick overview of how `True` and `False`
values can be used:

[source,python]
----
1 is 1
----
....
True
....

[source,python]
----
True == True
----
....
True
....

[source,python]
----
True == False
----
....
False
....

[source,python]
----
(1 == 1) == True
----
....
True
....

[source,python]
----
(1 == 2) == True
----
....
False
....

[source,python]
----
(1 == 2) == False
----
....
True
....

In _NumPy_ `True` and `False` values are also commonly used
for _masking_ ‚Äî or _selecting_ ‚Äî values from arrays. This will
be covered in more detail in the next chapter.



==== `None` of the above

So far you've been introduced to variable types for representing
numbers, strings of characters, lists, groups and dictionaries
of objects, arrays and true and false values. But sometimes you'll
want a value that is decicdely d) none of the above.

.This is a picture of nothing.
image::./img/030-python-none.jpg[]

Python provides for this in the `None` type.
Here are some things about `None`:

- `None` is equal to `None`
- `None` is not equal to _anything_ else
- all things that are `None` are equal
- all things that are `None` are the same

If the last two seem a little esoteric don't worry. Look at the examples below
to understand what is going on:

.`None` is equal to itself
[source,python]
----
None == None
----
....
True
....

[source,python]
----
None > None
----
....
False
....

.`None` is not equal to _anything_ else
[source,python]
----
1 == None
----
....
False
....

[source,python]
----
'hello' == None
----
....
False
....

.All things that are `None` are equal
[source,python]
----
a = None
b = None
----

[source,python]
----
a == None
----
....
True
....

[source,python]
----
a == b
----
....
True
....

.All things that are `None` are the same
[source,python]
----
a = None
b = None
a is None
----
....
True
....

[source,python]
----
a is b
----
....
True
....

The common use for `None` is as a representation of a non-existent value. For the
sake of your sanity it's best to stick with this approach.

TIP: Don't use `None` to mean _something_.

==== `inf` and beyond

There are two other not-really-a-number numbers
provided by _numpy_ that you may encounter. These are
`nan` and `inf`.

"Not a number" or `nan` is used whenever a number
was expected but was not found ‚Äî if you read a
`str` value into a numeric array, for example. Since it is not possible to represent
the string "Slartibartfast" as a number a `nan` will be used
in its place. Later we'll see how `nan` value can also be used as
_filler_ in arrays for values that you want to ignore.

When numeric calculations
go out of bounds or produce an unrepresentable number you'll instead
see infinity: `inf` or
its negative partner `-inf`. This indicates that what is there
_is a number_ but not one you can do anything with.

There is not much more to say about that.

==== Equality

To test for equality use the double-equals `==` sign.

[source,python]
----
1 == 2
----
....
False
....

[source,python]
----
1 == 1
----
....
True
....

WARNING: A single `=` is
used to assign a value to a variable. Mixing these up is a common source of
bugs, but Python will usually tell you when you do it.

[source,python]
----
1 = 1
----
....
File "<ipython-input-44-4c0a01f26144>", line 1
    1 = 1
SyntaxError: can't assign to literal
....

[source,pythons]
----
if a = 1:
   print("OK")
----
....
File "<ipython-input-45-1c60cd5d1ef6>", line 1
    if a = 1:
         ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
....

You can also test if something is greater `>`, less than `<`,
greater or equal `>=` and less than or equal `<=` to something else.


[source,python]
----
5 > 2
----
....
True
....

[source,python]
----
2 > 2
----
....
False
....

[source,python]
----
2 >= 2
----
....
True
....

[source,python]
----
5 >= 6
----
....
False
....

[source,python]
----
6 <= 6
----
....
True
....

[source,python]
----
5 <= 6
----
....
True
....

[source,python]
----
2 < 6
----
....
True
....

[source,python]
----
2 < 2
----
....
False
....

TIP: The order of the `>` or `<` and the `=` is important. If you write `=>` you will
get an error. Remember it as ‚Äúgreater or equal‚Äù and ‚Äúless than or equal‚Äù you'll
get it in the right order.


==== Sameness

`is`

==== Negation


==== Combining operators


=== Control structures `if...elif...else`



=== Iteration

You will often find yourself wanting to do things _more than once_. The na√Øve way
to do this is to copy and paste your code multiple times. But this is a _bad idea_.
If you find a bug in your code, you now have to fix it in multiple places. What happens if you miss one?
Bad things, that's what.

Thankfully Python provides a nice simple way to get things done _over and over again_. In
programming parlance this is called _iteration_. You will also hear the phrase
_iterate over_ which means working ‚Äî one item at a time ‚Äî through a sequence.
We'll take a close look at those now.

==== The `for...in` loop



==== For a `while`

Sometimes you don't know how long your loop needs to go on. In that case you
can't provide a range to the `for` loop as you don't know how big it needs to be.
Instead you can use the `while` construct which continues to loop
_while_ something is `True`.

[source,python]
----

----

A special case of this that you might find yourself using is the _infinite loop with break_.
Here we set `True` as the loop conditional which as we already know _always equals_ `True`.
The loop will continue until `break` is reached and the loop exits.

[source,python]
----
n = 0

while True:
    n += 1
    if n > 100:
        break
n
----
[role='white-background']
....
101
....

This construct can be useful when waiting for another task (or a remote API) to
complete. But in that case you will want to add a wait into the loop to avoid
being antisocial.


=== Functions

As your scripts grow in size you'll start to notice that you re-use common pieces
of code in different places. This can become messy and cause problems for
maintenance ‚Äî

The solution to this is to use _functions_ to


=== Comments

It is often useful to explain _in plain language_ what a piece of
code you have written is doing. In programming these bits of description
are called `comments'. They are completely ignored by Python while it runs
your code. It's a good habit to get used to commenting your code
thoroughly to keep it maintainable and clear.

TIP: If you format comments properly
they can even be used to automatically generate documentation for your software.

Python supports two types of comment: _inline_ and _block_.

==== Inline comments

Inline comments are single-line additions, usually after the line of source
code that they are commenting. For example:

[source,python]
----
cat = "Otgon"  # A good name for a cat
----

==== Block comments

Block comments are multi-line and are used for larger chunks of
documentation. They can be defined  using three single or double
quotation marks in a row, but double quotes are preferred:

[source,python]
----
"""
This is a multi-line block comment
that tells you something very interesting.
"""
----

TIP: Multi-line comments are actually string literals. You can
use the same syntax to assign multi-line strings to a variable.

=== Input and Output

=== Check your setup

Now you have all packages installed and set up, it is worth
taking a moment to test the installation. To make this as easy as possible
I've provided a script you can download to do this for you. The script
will run a series of tests to confirm whether packages you need for this book
(and others in the series) are correctly installed and functional.


FIXME - add remote script here


If you find something is not quite right, take a step back
and double check you have installed everything correctly. This
will save you much confusion later on!

TIP: If you can't figure out what is wrong, try uninstalling
each package and re-installing it again.

WARNING: Restart Python after each change (or restart your
kernel if in Spyder or IPython). This is the programming
equivalent of turning it on and off again. Congratulations, you're
now a tech support professional.

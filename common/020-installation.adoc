== Installation

=== Installing Python 3.x

This book is based on the latest version of Python (currently `3.4`). While many
examples will also work with version `2.7`, if you are starting out with Python
using the latest version will save you from upgrade problems in the future.

==== Windows

==== Mac

MacOS X comes with a version of Python pre-installed, so the simplest thing to
do would be to use that version, right? Wrong.

The default installation of Python is both old and tied to the operating
system. That means you cannot upgrade it without potentially knackering your
system. Since you paid lots of money for it, lets not do that.

Thankfully there is a simple solution in the form of Homebrew. This is a
_package manager_ for MacOS X that manages installation of system software
packages in a non-destructive way. You can even install multiple versions of
Python if you wish. Helpfully, it also includes a number of pre-made add on
packages for Python that are sometimes hard to install.

To install Homebrew open up a Terminal and enter:

[source,bash]
----
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
----

TIP: You can copy and paste this command from the Homebrew homepage at http://brew.sh

Once Homebrew has finished installing you can now install a version of Python
to use for programming. To install software using Homebrew you use the
`brew install` command, as follows:

[source,bash]
----
brew install python3
----


==== Linux



=== Tools

To write Python scripts you need nothing more complicated than a standard
text editor. We'll revisit this in later chapters when we look at packaging
and releasing our tools. However, for exploratory analysis and development of
ideas writing scripts can be a little bit cumbersome.

Thankfully there is a nice alternative - the Jupyter notebook interface.

==== Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter notebooks allow you to write Python code from within your web browser,
using an iterative step-by-step process. You can easily step back and forward
to run and re-run previous snippets of code, or edit and alter the behaviour.
Code outputs (text, figures, tables) are automatically displayed in the browser.

When you're finished you can save the outputs with the notebook - meaning
they're there to be viewed when you come back to your code, and can be used
as a rudimentary lab book, storing your processes.

TIP: Jupyter notebooks are also a great way to publish your methods alongside
your results. If you're interested in seeing what other scientists are
doing with Jupyter there is a list of reproducible publications available at
http://bit.ly/1Qlrr3T

To install Jupyter use:

[source,bash]
----
pip install jupyter
----

You can now launch the Jupyter web interface using:

[source,bash]
----
jupyter notebook
----

Your default web browser should open up, showing you the Jupyter notebook
management interface.

==== Editors and IDEs

If you want to release standalone scripts or package up your software for
release, at some point you will also need to have access to a text editor.
You don't need to install any of these yet, but here are a few future
recommendations depending on your platform:


- Windows: Notepad++
- Mac: TextWrangler
- Linux: gedit (Gnome) Kate (KDE)

If you start developing more complex software you may find it easier to work
with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). These tools provide a
more comprehensive workspace for software development, with integrated code
checking, documentation and much more. Examples include:

- PyCharm (Windows, Mac, Linux)

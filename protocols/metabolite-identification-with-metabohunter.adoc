=== 1D ^1^H NMR data processing

1D ^1^H NMR is a common technique applied to metabolomic studies, being well suited
to untargeted analysis of complex biofluids. It has been successfully applied to
the classification and diagnosis of a number of diseases including [ref].

MetaboHunter is a simple NMR fitting and quantification tool
from Dan Tulpan.  Submitted spectra are matched
peak-wise against a library of known compounds and then regions
of the spectra assigned to particular metabolites. This approach
has its limitations, but can be useful for a quick
overview of spectral components.

There is a Python package available to perform searching and matching
directly from within your scripts.

[source,bash]
pip3 install metabohunter

NOTE: This package was written by the author (Martin Fitzpatrick).

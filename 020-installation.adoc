=== Installing Python

While this book is based on Python `3.4` many examples will
also work with version `2.7`. However, if you are starting out with
Python you should use the latest version available â€” this is the future!


==== Windows

==== Mac

MacOS X comes with a version of Python pre-installed, so the simplest thing to
do would be to use that version, right? Wrong.

The default installation of Python is both old and tied to the operating
system. That means you cannot upgrade it without potentially knackering your
system. Since you paid lots of money for it, lets not do that.

Thankfully there is a simple solution in the form of Homebrew. This is a
_package manager_ for MacOS X that manages installation of system software
packages in a non-destructive way. You can even install multiple versions of
Python if you wish. Helpfully, it also includes a number of pre-made add on
packages for Python that are sometimes hard to install.

To install Homebrew open up a Terminal and enter:

[source,bash]
----
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
----

TIP: You can copy and paste this command from the Homebrew homepage at http://brew.sh

Once Homebrew has finished installing you can now install a version of Python
to use for programming. To install software using Homebrew you use the
`brew install` command, as follows:

[source,bash]
----
brew install python3
----


==== Linux

==== Alternatives

===== Anaconda


== Installation

=== Environments

==== Jupyter and the Notebook

Jupyter

the Jupyter notebook interface.

Jupyter notebooks enable you to write scripts within a simple web notebook
environment. It automatically displays code outputs (text, figures, tables)
and allow interactive re-running of code segments for debugging and
development. Even better, when you're finished you can save the outputs
with the notebook - meaning they're there to be viewed when you come
back to your code.

TIP: Jupyter notebooks are also a great way to publish your methods alongside
your results. If you're interested in seeing what other scientists are
doing with Jupyter there is a list of reproducible publications available at

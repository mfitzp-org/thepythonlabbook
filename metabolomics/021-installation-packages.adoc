=== nmrglue `nmrglue`

If you are planning on working with raw NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance)
spectroscopy data then you will want to install this fantastic package.
It natively reads a large number of NMR formats including
Varian, Bruker, NMRPipe, and Sparky files, and includes support for
many common NMR operations including phase and baseline correction.

=== MetaboHunter `metabohunter`

MetaboHunter is a simple NMR fitting and quantification tool
from Dan Tulpan.  Submitted spectra are matched
peak-wise against a library of known compounds and then regions
of the spectra assigned to particular metabolites. This approach
has its limitations, but can be useful for a quick
overview of spectral components.

There is a Python package available to perform searching and matching
directly from within your scripts.

[source,bash]
pip3 install metabohunter

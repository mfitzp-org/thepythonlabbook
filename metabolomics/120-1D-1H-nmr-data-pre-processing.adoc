=== 1D ^1^H NMR data pre-processing

1D ^1^H NMR is a common technique applied to metabolomic studies, being well suited
to untargeted analysis of complex biofluids. It has been successfully applied to
the classification and diagnosis of a number of diseases including [ref].

There are a number of important steps that must be applied prior 1D ^1^H NMR data
to statistical analysis, to ensure that the variation observed in the data is
representative of real biological variation and not a artifact of sample handling,
metabolite extraction or NMR acquisition. These steps are described briefly below
and approached in turn in the following method. It is important to familiarise
yourself with both the purpose of these steps, and any associated caveats or
limits, so that you can correctly apply them to your own data.

=== Check your setup

Now you have all packages installed and set up, it is worth
taking a moment to test the installation with a few quick
examples. Run the following snippets of code in your chosen
environment and check whether they:

a. work
b. produce the same output

If you find something is not quite right, take a step back
and double check you have installed everything correctly. This
will save you much confusion later on!

TIP: If you can't figure out what is wrong, try uninstalling
each package and re-installing it again.

WARNING: Restart Python after each change (or restart your
kernel if in Spyder or IPython). This is the programming
equivalent of turning it on and off again.

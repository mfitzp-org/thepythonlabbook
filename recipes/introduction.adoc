== Recipes

Recipes are snippets of reusable code that you will find yourself using over and over again. By combining these
short functions and scripts together you should be able to achieve anything you want to in your analysis. These recipes
are referenced when they are used (either directly, or in a derived form) elsewhere in the book, so you can see them
in action. You may find it useful to practise applying these recipes to some test data to become familiar with them, and
then use this section as a reference for your future work.

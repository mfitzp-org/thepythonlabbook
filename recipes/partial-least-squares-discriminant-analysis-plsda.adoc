=== Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA)

Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) is an adaptation of PLS
regression methods to the problem of supervised clustering. It has seen
extensive use in the analysis of multivariate datasets, such as that derived
from NMR-based metabolomics.


In this method the
groups within the samples are already known (e.g. experimental groups) and the
goal therefore is to determine two things â€”

1. Are the groups *actually* different.
2. What are the features that best describe the differences between the groups.

In an experimental context this means determining whether control and test
samples are different, and identifying the (known, quantified) experimental
variables that contribute to that difference.

PLS-DA is based on PLS regression (PLS-R) with the Y variable generated from
experimental group membership, mapped into a linear space. In a 2-group experiment
this can be as simple as 0 and 1.

==== Setting up

The implementation of PLS we will be using is provided by the `scikit-learn`
library. We will also be making use of `matplotlib` for plotting our outputs.

----
pip install sklearn matplotlib

The sample data for this section is available for download from:
http://www.thepythonlabbook.com/data/partial-least-squares-discriminant-analysis-plsda.zip

Download and unzip the file into your data folder.

For this demo we will be using 1D ^1^H NMR data as it makes explanation and
visualization of the PLS models easy to understand. However, you can easily
apply these same methods to any type of multivariate data set.

==== Loading the data

Before starting, let's take a look at the data we are working with.
Create a new Jupyter notebook using the Python 3 kernel, and in the first cell
enter and run the following. This will import all the neccessary libraries, as
well as using the `%matplotlib` magic to display output figures in the notebook.

[source,python]
----
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os
plt.style.use('ggplot')

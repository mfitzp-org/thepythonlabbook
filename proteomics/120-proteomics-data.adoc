== Proteomics Software and Data formats

=== Mass Spectrometry formats

There is a good review of all available mass spectrometry formats
in <<Deutsch2012>>.



==== Vendor formats (Thermo RAW, )

==== mzML
==== mzIdentML
==== mzXML
==== TraML
==== mzData


=== Software


==== MaxQuant

MaxQuant is ‘quantitative proteomics’ software which handles the
analysis step from raw mass spectra to quantified proteins. It
is designed for high-resolution MS data and supports quantification
via multiple labelling techniques and label-free quantification.

If reads RAW-format mass spectrometry files and writes out the
quantified proteins as standardized tab-delimited text.

TIP: You can download MaxQuant from the homepage at: http://www.maxquant.org

WARNING: This software is freely available but not _yet_ open source.
